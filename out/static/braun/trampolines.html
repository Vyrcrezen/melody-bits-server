        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        "<i
          >We are just two kids hollering Jesus over wild beats in as many
          countries as possible haha!</i
        >" - Lane Terzieff<br />
        Trampolines' members are Cary and Lane who compose Pop, Hip-Hop & Edm
        music and do missions work around the world. They got married on a
        trampoline, that's from where their name came from. They are stoked on
        God and want to make music that reflects that. They were in the
        mainstream pop music industry for a long time as a career and mission
        field but have now transitioned into intentionally going 100 percent
        God-focused on everything they do and are loving it.
        <h2>Message</h2>
        The main message their music represents is that you can worship God in
        <b>ANYTHING</b> and <b>EVERYTHING</b> you do! And that what God has done
        for us and is doing for us is worth jumping up and down out of
        excitement for. A lot of artists tell say "<em>Be Yourself</em>" but
        they really want to inspire people to find their message and their
        purpose in what they are doing and go 100 percent with it.
        <h2>Their most popular hit - <i>Maybe a new record?</i></h2>
        Trampolines relased one of their best hit <i>JESUS 10x</i> on
        05.22.2020. <br />
        The music video was filmed in a country where Christian outreach is
        illegal, they figured they would show up to one of the most populated areas
        in the world, crank up the boombox and jump around to JESUS 10x. If there
        was a world record for the amount of times Jesus was mentioned in a
        song, it's just been broken 10x over by Trampolines. That alone makes
        this song stand out, but the fact that it was recorded in a country
        where street evangelism is illegal blows that out of the water! Just
        like this track will. Picture someone being on fire for God, times it by
        ten, and translate it into a musical soundscape where even songs can
        have epileptic fits, and you have this track. The lyrical offering
        throughout is strong and emerges more and more with each listen, but
        it's the effervescent and scatty musical bedding that steals the
        spotlight. It's so stoked on Jesus even the synths are praising his name
        and having a massive dance party! To use a phrase we've used only once
        before, and one we would never use to describe Jesus himself, Jesus 10x
        is organised chaos. Oh boy is it organised chaos! It's bold, poetic,
        unashamed and illegal. It's beautiful.<br>
        JESUS 10x is out and listeners need to be warned, be wary of the dropsâ€¦
