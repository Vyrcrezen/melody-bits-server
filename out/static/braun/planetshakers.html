        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Planetshakers is a contemporary worship music band, a central part of Planetshakers Church in Melbourne, Australia. <br>
With over 30 albums, the band toured annually to the US, UK, Europe, South Africa, Asia, South America, Australia and New Zealand for some years, and has been nominated for several Dove Awards. 


        <h2>History</h2>
        Formed in Adelaide, South Australia, for the first Planetshakers Conference at Paradise Community Church (now known as Influencers Church) in Adelaide in 1997, the band is now based in Melbourne, Victoria at Planetshakers Church, which is under the leadership of senior pastors Russell and Samantha Evans. <br />
Guy Sebastian, member of the Planetshakers band from 2002 to 2005, was a worship leader and background vocals, recording albums for Planetshakers Church at Paradise Community Church conferences. He went on to win the first Australian Idol and has become a highly popular artist. <br />
It was reported in 2008 that Michael Guglielmucci, pastor of the church and former bass player in the Planetshakers band, had fraudulently claimed he was dying of cancer, and received money from supporters who believed his illness was real. He wrote "Healer", a song of encouragement for believers who were suffering from cancer, for the album Saviour of the World, which was released in June 2007. Guglielmucci explained his actions as being a result of a long-term pornography addiction. The track had also been added to the Hillsong album This Is Our God,[13] but later removed from the album.
