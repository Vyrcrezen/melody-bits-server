        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Sabaton is a Swedish heavy metal band from Falun, Sweden. The vast majority of their albums are written about historical events, mainly wars and significant battles. Sabaton has been referred to as one of the "big four" power metal bands, along with Helloween, Blind Guardian and DragonForce. They are one of the most successful metal bands in Swedish history, with their album Carolus Rex.
        <h2>Lyrical and musical style</h2>
        The band's main lyrical themes are based on war, historical battles, and acts of heroism, influenced by bands such as Iron Maiden. Their name is a reference to a sabaton, knight's foot armor. The armor and battle theme is heard in most songs in almost every album except Metalizer. In their albums, The Great War and The War To End All Wars, which were released on 19 July 2019 and 4 March 2022, all the songs were based on World War I. Lyrical content drawn from World War I, World War II and other historical conflicts is prevalent and lyrics often recite stories of heroic deeds by men, women, and armies, such as the song "White Death", for example, which was made in honor of legendary Finnish sniper Simo Häyhä. This song and other Sabaton lyrics have been criticized by Swedish historian Mikael Nilsson for avoiding the topic of Soviet communism and Soviet war crimes and sometimes glorifying the Soviet Union. <br />
The band's supposed pro-Soviet stance is reinforced by the facts that they performed at a show organized by Putin loyalist motorcycle club Night Wolves in Russian occupied Crimea in 2015, and that bassist Sundström in an interview with Sweden Rock Magazine 2016 stated that Crimea had previously been occupied by Ukraine. In 2022, Sabaton received a Public Educator Award from the Swedish Skeptics Association.<br />
Sabaton is often referred to as a power metal band by both music critics and the general public, deemed "a major force in the power metal field since the mid-2000s." However, the band has traditionally rejected the term and they consider themselves a unique form of heavy metal. Bassist Pär Sundström said in an interview: "I don't think Sabaton can only be categorized as power metal, as the two main attributes of power metal are high pitched vocals and fantasy lyrics and Sabaton have neither of those. We simply play our version of heavy metal—what heavy metal is to us. I'm sure that has impacted our reach, in addition to the fact that we don't give up after only a few tries! That, and Sabaton's music appeals to people of all ages." Joakim Brodèn has also made similar statements regarding the difference between Sabaton's low vocals and the high vocals of traditional power metal.
